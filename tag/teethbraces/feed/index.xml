<p>Aligned teeth give you more confidence and can make you look more beautiful. You may need to get your teeth aligned because of following reasons:</p>



<ul><li>crowded teeth</li><li>gap between your teeth</li><li>forwardly or inwardly placed teeth</li><li>overbite, deepbite and crossbite</li></ul>



<p>You can achieve good aligned teeth by undergoing an orthodontic treatment.</p>



<p><strong>Dental Visits</strong></p>



<ul><li>People think, ortho treatments are only for children and teens but they aren’t just for them.</li><li>You should know about your treatment durations. It may take around 1 – 2 years to improve your teeth and your smile.</li><li>Ortho Treatments are a bit costly. It is near about Rs.15000 to Rs.30000. It also depends upon the type of ortho treatment you are taking.</li><li>When you visit your orthodontist , he/she will record your case history by taking few x-rays like OPG , Lateral Ceph , photographs and oral impression.</li><li>The oral impression is taken by alginate. You may not like the taste but it’s not that difficult to hold it for 30 to 45 seconds.</li><li>On next visit, braces will be fixed to your teeth.</li></ul>



<p>You will also have choices to select the type of braces you want:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metallic Braces</strong> – They tend to move your teeth slightly faster than the other type of braces. They are also less expensive but may cause soreness and blisters on inner cheeks and gums. It is noticeable when you talk or smile.</li><li><strong>Ceramic Braces</strong> – Patients generally find ceramic braces more comfortable to wear than metallic ones. The ceramic materials aren’t abrasive so they won’t irritate your gums and the inner cheeks.</li><li><strong>Invisalign Braces</strong> – When you do want traditional metallic braces which are visible , you can go with invisalign braces. They won’t cause irritation and are also removable but they only work for minor teeth alignment issues.</li></ul>



<p>When your braces are fixed, you will initially feel pain, irritation, uncomfortableness and difficulty in speaking and chewing food. The pain occurs due to the movement of the tooth caused by the wires or braces. Mostly, the pain lasts for one to two weeks then it reduces . You will have to visit to the dentist many times after your braces are applied successfully.</p>



<p>Patients are advised to initially eat soft food .In order to maintain oral hygiene , one must use mouthwashes ( Listerine, Oral Plax etc.) twice daily.</p>



<h2>Debonding – Removal Of Braces</h2>



<p>After the completion of treatment, the orthodontist removes the braces with the help of instrument called micro-motor. After the removal of braces , you will have to wear retainers for about a year to stabilize and maintain the teeth in position. We are also given choices to retainers.</p>



<p><strong>Retainers</strong>&nbsp;–</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Removable Retainers</li><li>Fixed Retainers</li></ol>



<p>1.<strong>Removable Retainers</strong>&#8211; These are the retainers that can be easily removed and reinserted by the patient himself. This type of retainer is made up of acrylic and metallic wire. In this, a single horizontal wire will mostly cover the front 12 teeth.</p>



<p>There are also invisible retainers made up of ultra thin transparent thermoplastic sheets. These invisible retainers fully cover the entire portion of teeth. They can also be removed and reinserted. The main advantage of these type of retainers is that these are aesthetic and also they will help in good oral hygiene maintenance.</p>



<p>2.<strong> Fixed Retainers </strong>– They are fixed to the surface of the teeth. they cannot be removed by the patients. The retainer wire is bonded with the help of dental cement on the surface of teeth. Usually, only front 6 teeth are covered. The wire is bonded on the inner side of the teeth. The main disadvantage of these type of retainers is difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene which causes plaque accumulation between their teeth.</p>



<p><strong>HAPPY BRACING</strong></p>
