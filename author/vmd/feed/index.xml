<p>Harmful habits have negative impact on teeth and their supporting structures (bone and gums).</p>



<p>Some of the harmful habits in children are :</p>



<h2><strong>Thumb sucking</strong>&nbsp;:</h2>



<p>Children usually pick this habit when they are about 3 or 4 years old. If the child carries this habit beyond this age, it turns to be harmful as it causes misalignment of teeth. If the child is deprived of parental love , care and affection, he or she may grow insecurity and ultimately grow this habit of thumb sucking. Another reason to develop this habit could be hunger.</p>



<p><strong>Effects of Thumb Sucking on Your Child</strong>&nbsp;:</p>



<ul><li>Causes forward placement of teeth.</li><li>Gap between the upper and lower teeth is increased which eventually causes gap between lips</li><li>The upper front teeth becomes flared</li><li>Upper jaw becomes narrow</li></ul>



<p><strong>How to remove this habit :</strong></p>



<ul><li>By psychological approach, you can divert your child’s attention to other things such as play and toys.</li><li>By chemical approach, you can place bitter tasting preparation like pepper or asafoetida.</li></ul>



<h2>Mouth breathing :</h2>



<p>Instead of breathing from nose, child breaths from mouth. You can easily detect that your child is mouth breather. Some of the features</p>



<ul><li>Child’s lips are dry and chapped.</li><li>Nose and nasal passage looks narrow.</li><li>Face will look long and narrow.</li><li>Pigeon shaped chest.</li><li>Child will look bluish due to the increased amount of CO2 as filtration decreases (due to breathing from mouth instead of nose).</li></ul>



<p><strong>Management of Mouth breathing</strong></p>



<ul><li>The narrow upper jaw is corrected by the orthodontist by jaw expansion.</li><li>If there is any nasal obstruction it is removed surgically.</li></ul>



<h2>Tongue Thrusting :</h2>



<p>This habit can be seen in any age group. It is a habit in which the person places the tongue between their teeth during swallowing, speaking etc. The reasons could be improper bottle feeding, prolonged thumb sucking, prolonged upper respiratory infection and due to large tongue.</p>



<p><strong>Impacts of Tongue Thrusting :</strong></p>



<ul><li>Anterior open bite.</li><li>The front teeth shift forward</li><li>Upper jaw becomes narrow and shifts forward</li></ul>



<p><strong>How to Manage tongue thrust –</strong></p>



<ul><li>The way of swallowing should be corrected.</li><li>The teeth positions should be corrected by the dentist.</li><li>Need a dental treatment</li></ul>



<h2>Grinding of teeth (Bruxism) –</h2>



<p>For a non-functional purpose (not chewing or eating), if the child grinds his or her teeth, it’s a harmful habit.</p>



<p><strong>Impacts of Grinding teeth:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Teeth gets attrited.</li><li>The height of the teeth reduces.</li><li>It causes sensitivity to the teeth.</li><li>Causes pain in gums.</li><li>Teeth becomes mobile.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Management of Bruxism:</strong></p>



<ul><li>It is mainly due to stress, so stress should be reduced by relaxing.</li><li>The dentist will provide you the orthodontic appliance( night guard, occlusal splint), which protects the teeth.</li></ul>

<p>Aligned teeth give you more confidence and can make you look more beautiful. You may need to get your teeth aligned because of following reasons:</p>



<ul><li>crowded teeth</li><li>gap between your teeth</li><li>forwardly or inwardly placed teeth</li><li>overbite, deepbite and crossbite</li></ul>



<p>You can achieve good aligned teeth by undergoing an orthodontic treatment.</p>



<p><strong>Dental Visits</strong></p>



<ul><li>People think, ortho treatments are only for children and teens but they aren’t just for them.</li><li>You should know about your treatment durations. It may take around 1 – 2 years to improve your teeth and your smile.</li><li>Ortho Treatments are a bit costly. It is near about Rs.15000 to Rs.30000. It also depends upon the type of ortho treatment you are taking.</li><li>When you visit your orthodontist , he/she will record your case history by taking few x-rays like OPG , Lateral Ceph , photographs and oral impression.</li><li>The oral impression is taken by alginate. You may not like the taste but it’s not that difficult to hold it for 30 to 45 seconds.</li><li>On next visit, braces will be fixed to your teeth.</li></ul>



<p>You will also have choices to select the type of braces you want:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Metallic Braces</strong> – They tend to move your teeth slightly faster than the other type of braces. They are also less expensive but may cause soreness and blisters on inner cheeks and gums. It is noticeable when you talk or smile.</li><li><strong>Ceramic Braces</strong> – Patients generally find ceramic braces more comfortable to wear than metallic ones. The ceramic materials aren’t abrasive so they won’t irritate your gums and the inner cheeks.</li><li><strong>Invisalign Braces</strong> – When you do want traditional metallic braces which are visible , you can go with invisalign braces. They won’t cause irritation and are also removable but they only work for minor teeth alignment issues.</li></ul>



<p>When your braces are fixed, you will initially feel pain, irritation, uncomfortableness and difficulty in speaking and chewing food. The pain occurs due to the movement of the tooth caused by the wires or braces. Mostly, the pain lasts for one to two weeks then it reduces . You will have to visit to the dentist many times after your braces are applied successfully.</p>



<p>Patients are advised to initially eat soft food .In order to maintain oral hygiene , one must use mouthwashes ( Listerine, Oral Plax etc.) twice daily.</p>



<h2>Debonding – Removal Of Braces</h2>



<p>After the completion of treatment, the orthodontist removes the braces with the help of instrument called micro-motor. After the removal of braces , you will have to wear retainers for about a year to stabilize and maintain the teeth in position. We are also given choices to retainers.</p>



<p><strong>Retainers</strong>&nbsp;–</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Removable Retainers</li><li>Fixed Retainers</li></ol>



<p>1.<strong>Removable Retainers</strong>&#8211; These are the retainers that can be easily removed and reinserted by the patient himself. This type of retainer is made up of acrylic and metallic wire. In this, a single horizontal wire will mostly cover the front 12 teeth.</p>



<p>There are also invisible retainers made up of ultra thin transparent thermoplastic sheets. These invisible retainers fully cover the entire portion of teeth. They can also be removed and reinserted. The main advantage of these type of retainers is that these are aesthetic and also they will help in good oral hygiene maintenance.</p>



<p>2.<strong> Fixed Retainers </strong>– They are fixed to the surface of the teeth. they cannot be removed by the patients. The retainer wire is bonded with the help of dental cement on the surface of teeth. Usually, only front 6 teeth are covered. The wire is bonded on the inner side of the teeth. The main disadvantage of these type of retainers is difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene which causes plaque accumulation between their teeth.</p>



<p><strong>HAPPY BRACING</strong></p>
